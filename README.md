# Gameboy-Game-Genie
The Kicad files and rom dump of the Gameboy Game Genie by Galoob. This includes the additional PCBs for the buttons and the LED.

In the replacement board folder, you will find a version of the PCB that uses an Atmel AT27C256 (or chip of compatible size and pinout) to replace the chip blob. This enables anyone with a damaged PCB to restore the system. It has been tested.

PCB Thicknesses: 0.8 mm
